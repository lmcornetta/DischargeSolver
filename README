This is a first version of the solver implementation.
The 'make' command should be enough to compile it and generate the solver executable.
Please check dependencies for g++ or edit the Makefile.

The executable runs by:

./solver [initial mass (units of solar mass)] [initial charge (units of solar mass)] [output file name]
